# Identify Persons of Interest from Enron Email Dataset

## Summary
In this project, machine learning algroithms have been used to perform supervised classification of data to find persons of interest, who were involved in the finalancial disaster of Enron Corporation. E-mails of Enron employees were analyzed to detect persons of ineterst.

## Objective
* Understanding the various concepts of Machine Learning.
* Selecting the right algorithm for classification.
* Traing and testing of classification model.
* Validating performance of classification model using various metrics.

## Project Details
In 2002 Enron corporation suffered a finalncial collapse. The resulting Federal investigation, provided a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. This e-mail data was analyzed and a predictive model was created to find the people involved in the collapse. Preprocessing of the data was already carried out as part of the project. Feature Selection, cross validation and tuning of algorithm were done. The performance of the model was examined by building a confusion matrix.

## Tools Used
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
